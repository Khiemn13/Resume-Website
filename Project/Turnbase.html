            <h1>Turned Base Game</h1>
            <p>This project is a simple game that I created as part of my college course. Tarjetas is a turned-based carded game that was made in college using GameMaker Studio 2 and Piskel, this game focuses primarily on turned-based combat systems with unique mechanics such as elemental reactions and enemies that require specific strategies. This game includes several maps, basic sound effects, and some background music tracks. I designed the interface, battle logic, and enemy behaviors myself, as some core functions such as turns, movement, enemy behavior, and win/loss conditions were developed through self-learning and teacher assistance.
