        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hi, My name is Khiem Nguyen, and I am currently a second year university student at University of Tasmania. 
            I am passionate with software developments and I have experience in some programming languages,
            including Java and Python. I have worked on various projects that have helped me develop my skills in software development.
            Recently, I have been focusing on web development and have been learning HTML, CSS.    
            I also have experience in backend development and database design.

        <p>
            I'm driven by the satisfaction of seeing ideas been vizulized by code. I'm always willing to learn more, and improving my skills as software developer.
